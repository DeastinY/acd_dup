# Amazon Cloud Drive - Directory Uploadloader

Uploads a directorystructure recursively to Amazon Cloud Drive.
Uses [acd_cli](https://github.com/yadayada/acd_cli) to access acd. You'll need to run through the setup of acd_cli first.

You can set the base-directory, some filters for wanted extensions and stuff to ignore in the .py file.
Probably the whole script can be replaced with some nice acd_cli options, but I realized this just after finishing.

Feel free to contribute in any way, I'd love some help !
